# Translations
When a new command is added i usally make it's respective translations, if I don't I'll just make them later, but if you want to contribute you are welcome to do so!

The fallback language when no translation found is `en-US`

# KNOWN bugs/errors
1. Error messages may be ephemeral or not
2. Error messages are not readable for "non-dev" users

# Self-hosting
Zeyr team does not support the idea of people self-hosting their own instance of Zeyr, we kindly ask you to use our self-hosted version.

# Older version
If you want Zeyr's old code (not that old, still used) please refer to [brxem/zeyr](https://github.com/brxem/zeyr), eventually that repo wont be updated anymore, please stay up-to-date üôè
